I was recently sent a code challenge to build out an app where I create a Node/Express backend with GraphQL, & an interface of my choice and have that be my API endpoint for my React frontend. This blog post will go into detail on how I approached it and what some of the struggles were in implementing them.

# The Challenge
Using React, GraphQL and your choice of GraphQl client (we use Relay but you are no required), create an API from which you can query from to display books. We have a attached a JSON file of 100 books to use. The user should be able to display 10 books initially, paginate through the books and also perform a fuzzy search. The books should display in a grid format. When complete please push your code to a Github repo and provide a link.

# Acceptance Criteria
Display 10 books at a time.
Allow the user to paginate through the books.
Allow the user to search through the books by title.
Style the grid and layout
# Bonus Criteria (optional)
Create units tests for created components.
Allow the user to click into an individual book page and display more details

Note:
If you don’t have experience with GraphQL, feel free to build API using Node.JS and use it in React Components.
