> I should have studied computer science in college. Or is where I'm at now, where I was meant to be all along?


The thoughts of "Where would I be if...." was constantly in head when I began to seriously consider attending a coding bootcamp. I had never truely sought a formal education in software development with the exception of a Web Design Certificate from Hunter College years ago, where I coincidentally ended up meeting the love of my life. 

I have always had a knack with computers and technology. It took me the better part of 7 years to truly understand that this career choice is the one that I will succeed in, but requires the discipline and persistence of a samurai. Anything less will yield insufficient results. 

'Am I too old to get started in this?', I asked myself. It was not a quick changeover in deciding I wanted to actually be a software developer. I will be turning 30 in 2 months, and I feel like I made the best decision of my life by becoming fundamentally committed about working in software development. 

It won't be easy. it won't be overnight. The frustration will be plenty. The struggle will be real.

The finish line for completing the Full Stack Web Development Program is only the beginning of a much larger and ambitious journey.

Bring it on.
